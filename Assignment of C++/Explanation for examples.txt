* Explanation for example 1
This hello word displayed with help of different main.cpp(c++ language) where we use
#include <iostream>: include input,output library, this include a library that helps to use court(to print message to the screen) and cin(to read an integer from standard input)
int main(): main function,this is where program start.
Return 0; this indicate successfull excution.
* Explanation for example 2
Using data type and valuables to display the output and we cannot use special characters or space characters or space and even case sensitive
Because Age is different from age, the first one start with upper case and the second one start with lower case.
Must start with a letter or underscores (_).
We have to declare their data type like int,float,double,bool,string
* Explanation for example 3
For this one, how it works:   cin>>name; *takes user input for the variable name.
.     cin>> age, takes user input for age.
.      The values are them printed back to the user 
Here we try running this program and enter different names and ages!
* Explanation for example  4
Here we have operators,operators help us calculation and make decisions.
It is also used for math operations, like addition,substraction,multiplication and division.
Now that you understand the basics, we will move on to decisions making (if-else),loops,function, and more
